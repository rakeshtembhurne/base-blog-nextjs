# Unix vs. Linux

Linux and UNIX are separate operating systems with diverse histories, although having certain similarities.

The UNIX operating system family was created by AT&T Bell Laboratories in the 1970s. Currently, a number of businesses maintain their own UNIX versions, including IBM's AIX and Oracle's Solaris.

Contrarily, Linus Torvalds developed the open-source operating system Linux in the early 1990s. It is frequently referred to as a "UNIX-like" operating system because UNIX served as its inspiration. Many Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian, are available and well-liked by a sizable community.
