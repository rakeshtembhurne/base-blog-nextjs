Are you an Instagram enthusiast with an ever-growing collection of your favourite videos? If so, you're probably familiar with the struggle of organizing and enjoying them as a single continuous video.

Instagram is a treasure trove of engaging videos, and it's natural to want to save and combine your favorites into a single video for easy viewing. This blog post will guide you through the entire process, from finding and downloading your favorite Instagram videos to combining them into one.

We will also address many common questions related to Instagram favorites, downloading videos, and more.

## Step 1: Downloading Instagram Videos

Download Your Favorite Instagram Videos To begin, navigate to the Instagram activity page that showcases your liked videos by visiting [Your Instagram Likes](https://www.instagram.com/your_activity/interactions/likes/). Click on each liked video, which will take you to the respective video page. Next, copy the video URL and head over to [Inflact Instagram Video Downloader](`https://inflact.com/downloader/instagram/video/`) and download the video. Repeat this process for all your favourite videos.

## Step 2: The Easiest Video

Combine the Videos Initially, you might try to combine the downloaded videos with a simple script, as shown below:

```bash
for f in *.mp4; do echo "file '$f'" >> input_files.txt; done

ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i input_files.txt -c copy output.mp4

rm input_files.txt
```

However, this approach may result in errors, especially if the videos have different resolutions, codecs, or frame rates.

## Step 3: The Final Solution Without Errors

The Perfect Solution To successfully merge your Instagram videos, use the following script. It resizes all videos to a common resolution (1280x720 in this example), re-encodes them with a constant frame rate (30 fps), and uses common codecs (H.264 for video and AAC for audio).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a tmp folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p tmp

# Step 1: Resize all videos and save them in the tmp folder
for f in *.mp4; do
    ffmpeg -i "$f" -vf "scale=1280:720:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1280:720:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p -r 30 "tmp/resized_${f}"
done

# Step 2: Prepare input files and filter_complex string for resized videos
input_files=()
filter_complex_str=""

i=0
for f in tmp/resized_*.mp4; do
    input_files+=("-i" "$f")
    filter_complex_str+="[$i:v][$i:a]"
    i=$((i+1))
done

filter_complex_str+="concat=n=$i:v=1:a=1[outv][outa]"

# Step 3: Combine resized videos using filter_complex
ffmpeg "${input_files[@]}" -filter_complex "$filter_complex_str" -map "[outv]" -map "[outa]" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4

# Cleanup
rm -r tmp
```

This script creates a temporary folder, resizes and re-encodes the videos, and then concatenates them using FFmpeg's filter_complex method. After the process, the temporary folder is removed, and your favourite Instagram videos are combined into a single file named `output.mp4`.
