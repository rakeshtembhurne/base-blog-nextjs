## Excitement with the new Raspberry Pi 5

I have been using Raspberry Pi, ever since the beginning Raspberry Pi. In early versions, Raspberry Pi was not supporting wifi and bluetooth. That time, I customized it add external wifi, and battery module to work independently as a router, and conduct online tests.

## Projects I Did with Raspberry Pi
- **Exam Server**: A wifi based server to conduct online exams. Added battery and wifi services externally.
- **Tempreature Alert System**: A small ciruit with the help of Raspberry Pi Pico, that beeps when the tempreature rises to a certain limit.
- **Desktop Machine**: Used as regular desktop machine, to practice programming
- **Raspberry Pi Cluster**: A Cluster of 8 Rasbperry pi machine to study the cluster mode softwares

## What do I love about Raspberry Pi

Being a linux enthusiast, I was alway curious how can I run my programs on such a small machine. Though early versions of Raspberry Pi were lacking some important features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and so on, but eventually new and new versions of Raspberry Pi came into existence, new upgrades came with those missing and important features.

Currently, I don't use Raspberry Pi as a desktop environment, but I mostly prefer Raspberry Pi pico for doing small electronics projects.

### New Processor 
One of the top highlights of the Raspberry Pi 5 is its processor. The new Raspberry Pi Broadcom BCM2712 2.4GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 CPU. It comes with cryptography extensions, 512KB per-core L2 caches and a 2MB shared L3 cache. This processor give 2-3 times speed improvements over previous versions.

### Enhanced Graphics
- VideoCore VII GPU, supporting OpenGL ES 3.1, Vulkan 1.2
- Dual 4Kp60 HDMI® display output with HDR support
- 4Kp60 HEVC decoder

### Improved I/O
- Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi®
- Bluetooth 5.0 / Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- microSD card slot, with support for high-speed SDR104 mode
- 2 × USB 3.0 ports, supporting simultaneous 5Gbps operation
- 2 × USB 2.0 ports
- Gigabit Ethernet, with PoE+ support (requires separate PoE+ HAT)

### Other Noteworthy Improvements
- 2 × 4-lane MIPI camera/display transceivers
- **PCIe 2.0 x1 interface** for fast peripherals (requires separate M.2 HAT or other adapter). This is a very important step because it will give significant speed to Raspberry Pi. 
- **5V/5A DC power** via USB-C, with Power Delivery support
- Raspberry Pi standard 40-pin header
- **Real-time clock (RTC)**, powered from external battery. Though it was supported with external circuits/modules, but they have come up with official solution now. Also came to know that it uses rechargable cell, which is really appreciable.
- **Power button**: Which was missing in all the previous versions. Hopefully it solves the quick shutdown problem, and allows for graceful shutdown, which is a long coming problem with Raspberry Pis.
