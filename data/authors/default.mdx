Hello, I am Rakesh Tembhurne. I am a Software Engineer from Nagpur, India. I love programming, reading, writing and some social activities.

Having more than 12 years of experience in high performance full stack web applications, I have worked with a lot of different technologies and different global teams.

Before 2014, I mostly worked with PHP programming language, even got PHP Zend Certified. Then I shifted my focus entirely on the JavaScript / NodeJS technologies.

In free time, I like to build and play with electronics circuits. I heavily blogged in period 2009 to 2011, but since then I mostly been developing apps.
